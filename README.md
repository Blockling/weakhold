# weakhold
A game based on the strategy simulator "Stronghold Crusader 2"(can only recommend).
This game will be a text-based and overall simplified version of Stronghold.
It will feature resources, troops, enemies, buildings and simple combat.
In the End this should be an interactive game, which possibly will also feature a GUI.

How to play: basically, you just type the option which you would like to select.
The goal is to reduce the enemies health to zero, while holding yours above zero.
You lose health through food, if you have less than zero, or through defending an enemy attack or attacking your enemy.
Also, try not to go into debt, you will likely recover, but possibly too slowly.
If you attack often, you will deal a lot of extra damage, if you defend a lot, you will receive a lot of extra damage.
You make food with a: wheatfarm, windmill and a bakery.
To recruit troops you need a barrack, aswell as a shield, sword, or bow, which also need iron or wood.
If you have any other questions, feel free to ask, or just look through the code.

This project is definetely not complete, but i do not want to work on it anymore.
