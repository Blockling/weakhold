# weakhold
A game based on the strategy simulator "Stronghold Crusader 2"(can only recommend)
This game will be a text-based and overall simplified version of Stronghold
It will feature resources, troops, enemies, buildings, troops and castles
If I have enough time i will also implement the "mood" system, which is influenced by a lot of different factors and is overall very complicated
In the End this should be an interactive game, which possibly will also feature a GUI
